# Exercise 1: Accessing Tuple Elements
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date")

# Print the first item
print(fruits[0])

# Print the last item using negative index
print(fruits[-1])

# Print the second and third items using slicing
print(fruits[1:3])


# Exercise 2: Tuple Operations
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)

# Combine them into a new tuple
combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(combined_tuple)

# Multiply tuple1 by 2
multiplied_tuple = tuple1 * 2
print(multiplied_tuple)


# Exercise 3: Tuple Methods & Unpacking
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Tuple unpacking
a = numbers[0]
b = numbers[1]
rest = numbers[2:]
print(a)
print(b)
print(rest)

# Count how many times 20 appears
count_20 = numbers.count(20)
print(count_20)

# Find the index of 40
index_40 = numbers.index(40)
print(index_40)
